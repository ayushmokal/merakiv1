# üöÄ Deploy Fixed Google Apps Script

## Issue Fixed
The inconsistent property count issue (showing 11 instead of 21 residential properties) has been resolved.

**Root Cause**: The filtering logic in Google Apps Script was incorrectly filtering out lease properties when `transactionType=ALL`.

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

1. **Enhanced Filtering Logic**: 
   - When `transactionType=ALL`, now includes ALL properties (both buy and lease)
   - Improved handling of empty or undefined transaction type data
   - Better matching for buy/sale and lease/rent variations

2. **Robust Transaction Type Detection**:
   - Added `determineTransactionType()` helper function
   - Handles empty, undefined, or inconsistent data
   - Proper fallback to 'buy' when data is missing

## üìã Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Copy the Updated Script
Copy the contents of `/appscripts/merakix504labs_propertiesDB.txt` (the fixed version)

### Step 2: Update Your Google Apps Script
1. Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)
2. Open your existing property script
3. **Replace all existing code** with the updated script
4. Save the project (Ctrl+S)

### Step 3: Redeploy
1. Click **"Deploy"** ‚Üí **"New deployment"**
2. Choose **"Web app"** as type
3. Set execute as: **"Me"**
4. Set access: **"Anyone"**
5. Click **"Deploy"**
6. **Copy the new deployment URL**

### Step 4: Update Environment Variable (if needed)
If you get a new deployment URL, update your `.env.local`:
```
GOOGLE_PROPERTY_API_URL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_NEW_DEPLOYMENT_ID/exec
```

### Step 5: Test
1. Restart your Next.js server: `npm run dev`
2. Test the filtering:
   - **All Properties**: Should show 45 properties
   - **Residential**: Should consistently show **21 properties** (both buy and lease)
   - **Residential ‚Üí Buy**: Should show **11 properties** (buy only)
   - **Residential ‚Üí Lease**: Should show **10 properties** (lease only)

## üéØ Expected Results

**Before Fix**:
- Residential: 11 properties (inconsistent, missing lease)
- Residential ‚Üí Buy: 11 properties ‚úÖ

**After Fix**:
- Residential: **21 properties** (consistent, includes all)
- Residential ‚Üí Buy: **11 properties** ‚úÖ
- Residential ‚Üí Lease: **10 properties** ‚úÖ

## üîç Verification

Check your browser console logs - you should see:
```
Response Total: 21  (for Residential ALL)
Response Total: 11  (for Residential BUY)
Response Total: 10  (for Residential LEASE)
```

The inconsistent "11 then 21" behavior should be completely resolved!
