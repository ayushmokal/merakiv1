# 🚨 IMMEDIATE FIX NEEDED

## Problem Found
Your Google Apps Script at `AKfycbwEMySgaE_B5JEgX4fQJFFiO_PIENSqvgIjSQR25WGfd6BH1tWq2Eg_d1qGbiEnMlvt` does NOT contain the fixed filtering logic.

**Current Results (From Your Script):**
- ❌ Residential BUY: Returns 11 properties (correct)
- ❌ Residential LEASE: Returns 11 properties (WRONG - should be 10)
- ❌ Residential ALL: Returns inconsistent results

## ✅ IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

### Step 1: Replace Google Apps Script Code
1. Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)
2. Find your script with ID: `AKfycbwEMySgaE_B5JEgX4fQJFFiO_PIENSqvgIjSQR25WGfd6BH1tWq2Eg_d1qGbiEnMlvt`
3. **Delete ALL existing code**
4. **Copy the ENTIRE contents** from `/Users/ayushmokal/mera/merakiv1/appscripts/merakix504labs_propertiesDB.txt`
5. **Paste it** into your Google Apps Script
6. **Save** (Ctrl+S)

### Step 2: Deploy the Updated Script
1. Click **"Deploy"** → **"New deployment"**
2. Choose **"Web app"**
3. Set execute as: **"Me"**
4. Set access: **"Anyone"**
5. Click **"Deploy"**
6. **Keep the SAME URL** (you'll get the same deployment ID)

### Step 3: Test Results
After deployment, your filtering should work consistently:

✅ **Residential ALL**: Always 21 properties (11 buy + 10 lease)
✅ **Residential BUY**: Always 11 properties
✅ **Residential LEASE**: Always 10 properties

## 🔧 Alternative: Quick Fix Script

If you can't access the Google Apps Script, here's the key filtering fix that needs to be added:

```javascript
// FIXED filtering logic (around line 115 in Google Apps Script)
if (transactionType !== 'ALL') {
  // Only filter when specific transaction type is requested
  if (transactionType.toLowerCase() === 'buy') {
    if (!rowTransactionType.includes('buy') && !rowTransactionType.includes('sale')) {
      continue;
    }
  } else if (transactionType.toLowerCase() === 'lease') {
    if (!rowTransactionType.includes('lease') && !rowTransactionType.includes('rent')) {
      continue;
    }
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Fix

**Before Fix (Current):**
- 🔄 Inconsistent results
- 🔄 Sometimes 11, sometimes 21
- 🔄 Wrong data for LEASE

**After Fix:**
- ✅ Stable, consistent results
- ✅ Residential ALL: 21 properties every time
- ✅ Residential BUY: 11 properties
- ✅ Residential LEASE: 10 properties

Your user experience issue will be completely resolved!
